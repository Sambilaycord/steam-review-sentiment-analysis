        "## **Phase 1: API Selection — Steam User Reviews API**\n",
        "### **Overview:**\n",
        "Steam is one of the world's largest digital distribution platforms for PC gaming, hosting thousands of games and millions of active players. The Steam Web API allows developers and researchers to access various types of public data from the platform, such as game information, user statistics, and community content.\n",
        "<br><br>\n",
        "### **Focus of the Analysis**\n",
        "Our project explores the question:\n",
        "\n",
        "> *“What factors influence how players review games on Steam, and how do those reviews reflect player experience and engagement?”*\n",
        "\n",
        "Through this analysis, we aim to identify patterns that connect:\n",
        "- **Player engagement** (playtime, ownership history)  \n",
        "- **Behavioral indicators** (helpful votes, purchase type)  \n",
        "- **Sentiment or recommendation trends** (voted_up vs. review content)\n",
        "\n",
        "We will analyze these relationships to uncover how players form opinions and how engagement behaviors influence review positivity or negativity.\n",
        "<br><br>\n",
        "### **What Kind of Data the Steam User Reviews API Provides**\n",
        "The Steam User Reviews API provides a wide range of fields describing user behavior, playtime, and feedback. Below are some of the most relevant fields that will be used in our analysis:\n",
        "| Field | Description |\n",
        "|:------|:-------------|\n",
        "| `review` | The text content of the user’s review |\n",
        "| `voted_up` | Indicates whether the user recommended the game (positive = True, negative = False) |\n",
        "| `votes_up` | Number of users who found the review helpful |\n",
        "| `author.num_games_owned` | Total number of games owned by the reviewer |\n",
        "| `author.num_reviews` | Number of reviews written by the user |\n",
        "| `author.playtime_forever` | Total lifetime playtime (in minutes) for the game |\n",
        "| `author.playtime_last_two_weeks` | Playtime in the past two weeks |\n",
        "| `author.playtime_at_review` | Playtime at the time the review was written |\n",
        "| `timestamp_created` | Unix timestamp when the review was created |\n",
        "| `timestamp_updated` | date the review was last updated (unix timestamp) |\n",
        "| `steam_purchase` | True if the review came from a verified Steam purchase |\n",
        "| `received_for_free` | True if the game was received for free |\n",
        "| `written_during_early_access ` | true if the user posted this review while the game was in Early Access |\n",
        "\n",
        "These selected fields will serve as the foundation for our analysis of player engagement, review behavior, and sentiment trends.\n",
        "\n",
        "By combining metadata such as playtime and ownership with review outcomes (e.g., voted_up), we can uncover what factors drive positive or negative reviews and how engagement reflects player satisfaction across different games.\n",
        "<br><br>\n",
        "### **Example: How to Call the Steam User Reviews API**\n",
        "The Steam User Reviews API endpoint is structured as follows:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "https://store.steampowered.com/appreviews/{app_id}?json=1\n",
        "```\n",
        "Replace {app_id} with the game’s unique Steam App ID.\n",
        "Adding ?json=1 ensures the response is returned in JSON format.\n",
        "For example, the game Stardew Valley has the App ID 413150.\n",
        "To retrieve its reviews:\n"
