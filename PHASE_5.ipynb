        "> “What factors influence how players review games on Steam, and how do those reviews reflect player experience and engagement?”\n",

        "2.  **Storage:** Architecting a relational database on Supabase (PostgreSQL).\n",
        "3.  **Processing:** Using SQL logic for efficient data cleaning and feature engineering.\n",

        "*   *Observation:* Positive reviews have a median lifetime playtime of **~60 hours**, while negative reviews sit at **~41.5 hours**.\n",
        "*   *Insight:* Higher engagement correlates with satisfaction. Players who invest significant time are more likely to recommend the game. However, the high playtime of negative reviewers suggests many are \"Disappointed Veterans\" rather than quick refunds.\n",
        "\n",
        "**B. The \"Parting Shot\" Theory**\n",
        "We engineered a metric called `playtime_ratio` (Playtime at Review / Total Lifetime Playtime).\n",
        "*   *Observation:* Negative reviews have a median ratio of **1.0**.\n",
        "*   *Insight:* This indicates that users often write negative reviews immediately upon quitting the game forever (\"Rage Quitting\"), whereas positive reviewers often continue playing after reviewing (~0.99 ratio).\n",
        "\n",
        "**C. Review Length & Helpfulness**\n",
        "*   *Observation:* Negative reviews are significantly longer (median **30 words**) than positive reviews (median **14 words**). They also receive more \"Helpful\" votes (median 1 vs 0).\n",
        "*   *Insight:* Unhappiness requires explanation. Players write detailed critiques to warn others, and the community values these warnings highly over generic praise.\n",
        "\n",
        "**D. The \"Critical Connoisseur\"**\n",
        "*   *Observation:* Negative reviewers own significantly more games (median **75**) compared to positive reviewers (median **25**).\n",
        "*   *Insight:* Experienced players with large libraries are harsher critics, likely due to higher standards and broader comparisons.\n",

        "We built a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model to classify reviews based solely on text content. We compared **Naive Bayes** and **Logistic Regression**.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Model Architecture:**\n",
        "*   **Input:** `review_text` transformed via **TF-IDF Vectorization** (to weigh unique words higher than common ones).\n",
        "*   **Algorithm:** `LogisticRegression` with `class_weight='balanced'`.\n",
        "*   **Optimization:** The balanced class weight was crucial to overcome the 96% positivity bias that rendered Naive Bayes ineffective for detecting negatives.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Interpretation:**\n",
        "The model successfully verified that distinct keywords drive sentiment. Emotional keywords (\"fun\", \"love\") drive positive sentiment, while technical issues (\"crash\") or lack of engagement (\"boring\") drive negative sentiment. The presence of **\"update\"** as a negative driver confirms the \"Disappointed Veteran\" theory—patches can turn loyal fans into critics.\n",

        "### **Synthesis & Findings**\n",
        "\n",
        "By connecting our quantitative analysis with our machine learning results, we can construct a holistic picture of the Steam review ecosystem. This section synthesizes our disparate findings into cohesive themes.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **A. The Dual Nature of Steam Reviews**\n",
        "Our data reveals a **bimodal user base** with distinct behavioral patterns:\n",
        "1.  **The \"Silent\" Majority:** These users make up ~96% of the ecosystem. They play games extensively (median ~60 hours), purchase via standard channels, and leave short, positive reviews like *\"10/10 best game\"* or *\"masterpiece.\"* Their engagement is high, but their specific feedback is often generic.\n",
        "2.  **The Vocal Minority:** These are the \"Veteran Critics.\" They own significantly more games (median ~75 vs. 25), write more reviews, and exhibit lower recent playtime. Their negative reviews are notably longer (median ~30 words vs. 14), indicating that dissatisfaction requires justification.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **B. The \"Point of No Return\"**\n",
        "A critical finding is the predictive power of the **`playtime_ratio`**.\n",
        "*   When `playtime_at_review` equals `playtime_forever` (ratio = 1.0), the review is far more likely to be **negative**.\n",
        "*   This suggests a specific user journey: A player encounters a frustration point (crash, bad mechanic, poor optimization), writes a negative review, and immediately uninstalls the game. This \"Rage Quit\" signal is one of the strongest indicators of negative sentiment we found.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **C. Content is King (Acquisition is Irrelevant)**\n",
        "We tested the hypothesis that users who received the game for free might be more lenient (higher positivity) or that Steam purchasers might be more critical due to financial investment.\n",
        "*   **Result:** We found **no statistically significant difference** in review sentiment based on acquisition method (`steam_purchase` vs. `received_for_free`).\n",
        "*   **Implication:** Players evaluate games primarily on their intrinsic quality (fun factor, stability) rather than the transaction method. A bad game is a bad game, regardless of price.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **D. The Language of Satisfaction vs. Frustration**\n",
        "Our machine learning model provided a lexical map of user sentiment:\n",
        "*   **Positive Sentiment:** Driven by emotional and experiential words like *fun, love, great, best, peak*. This reflects a subjective, enjoyment-based evaluation.\n",
        "*   **Negative Sentiment:** Driven by functional and technical words like *crash, boring, waste, update*. This reflects an objective failure of the product to perform or engage.\n",
        "*   **Synthesis:** Positive reviews celebrate the **experience**; negative reviews critique the **product**. This distinction is crucial for developers seeking to improve their games.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Conclusion & Recommendations**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Conclusion:**\n",
        "Our analysis confirms that the Steam review ecosystem is heavily biased towards positivity. However, the minority of negative reviews are high-value signals: they come from experienced \"veteran\" players (high game ownership), are written in greater detail, and signal the end of that player's lifecycle with the game. \"Boring\" was identified as the ultimate sin, carrying more weight than technical flaws.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Recommendations:**\n",
        "1.  **For Developers:** Pay close attention to long, negative reviews from high-playtime users, especially after updates. These are not trolls; they are disappointed superfans providing detailed technical feedback.\n",
        "2.  **For Future Analysis:** Implement **Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA)** to automatically bucket reviews into categories like \"Graphics,\" \"Gameplay,\" or \"Performance\" based on the keywords identified in our ML model.\n",
